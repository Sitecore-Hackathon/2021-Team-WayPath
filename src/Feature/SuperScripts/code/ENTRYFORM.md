## Pre-requisites
Sitecore Powershell Extensions

## Installation instructions
Simply install the SuperScripts.zip package!

### Configuration
Superscripts come with several out of box scripts, but more can be added.

To add more scripts, under the master database navigate to: /sitecore/system/Modules/PowerShell/Script Library/Super Scripts
From here you will select an existing or add your own Integration Point Library.  Then add your scripts under it using available insert options.  Followed by a Powershell Script Library.
And finally the Powershell script itself under that.  Review the current structure for better understanding.

## Usage instructions
⟹ Provide documentation about your module, how do the users use your module, where are things located, what do the icons mean, are there any secret shortcuts etc.

Include screenshots where necessary. You can add images to the `./images` folder and then link to them from your documentation:

![Hackathon Logo](docs/images/hackathon.png?raw=true "Hackathon Logo")

You can embed images of different formats too:
