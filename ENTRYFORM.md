## Pre-requisites
Sitecore Powershell Extensions

## Installation instructions
Simply install the SuperScripts.zip package!

### Configuration
Superscripts come with several out of box scripts, but more can be added.

To add more scripts, under the master database navigate to: /sitecore/system/Modules/PowerShell/Script Library/Super Scripts
From here you will select an existing or add your own Integration Point Library.  Then add your scripts under it using available insert options.  Followed by a Powershell Script Library.
And finally the Powershell script itself under that.  Review the current structure for better understanding.

## Usage instructions
From the dashboard, click on Super Scripts from the modules section.
